- furthermore, the csv is loaded so that in the intelligences_platform.db

# week 9
- developing the web application using streamlit 
- to run the streamlit page i have to run the "home.py" file 
- here is the command i have used to run the streamlit ---> "streamlit run home.py"
- the web application perform the crud operation of each domain and and there is an ai analyser for cyber incident problem and it tickets problem
